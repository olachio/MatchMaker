        <h3>Guidance Based on Research:</h3>
        <p>This is the first app to offer evidence based assistance in creating your rank order list for residency. Research has consistently shown the following factors to be crucial in determining residency program fit:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Alignment with Personal Values: Prioritizing programs that align with your values increases the likelihood of a positive experience and professional success (England et al., 2020; Raj, 2016; Murphy, 2023).</li>
            <li>Supportive Learning Environment: Programs fostering collaboration and support contribute to a sense of belonging and strong relationships with faculty and peers (Lases et al., 2018; Stahn & Harendza, 2014).</li>
            <li>Quality of Mentorship and Supervision: Access to experienced and supportive faculty enhances training experience and career development (Bates et al., 2020; Ellis et al., 2021).</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Comprehensive Evaluation Criteria:</h3>
        <p>Our app helps you evaluate residency programs across multiple dimensions, ensuring a holistic assessment. Consider the following factors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Program Resources and Opportunities: Assess research opportunities, conferences, specialized training, and career development support (Luk et al., 2018; Nemani et al., 2014).</li>
            <li>Geographic Location and Lifestyle Factors: Evaluate whether the location aligns with your lifestyle preferences, including opportunities for outdoor activities and cultural experiences (The Important Factors Applicants Consider When Choosing a Residency: A Survey Study, 2022).</li>
            <li>Program Reputation and Patient Population: Consider the program's reputation and its alignment with your professional goals (Yarris et al., 2009).</li>
        </ul>
